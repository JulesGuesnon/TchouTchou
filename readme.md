# Tchoutchou :train2:

Tchoutchou is a video game made for a school project where we had a week and a half to produce a mobile app.

## What is Tchoutchou ?

### Storytelling :book:

In 2045, a global war broke out.
Decades of overexploitation and pollution had rendered the majority of the Earth's resources unfit for exploitation and human consumption. The world was on fire and blood.
Faced with the indifference of leaders, the world population rose up. The earth's fauna and flora disappeared to the rhythm of the wars that ravaged the globe.
It's 2057, and the last survivors are still buried. Coming to the surface has become a dream, the tunnels of lawlessness. The search for food and materials is a daily challenge.

### Game mechanics :video_game:

Tchoutchou is a real-time strategic rogue-like. The object of the game is to travel a train line. The player starts with a train consisting of a single unimproved locomotive.

Along the way, he faces many challenges and choices that can help him improve his train by adding wagons, power or weapons. These events can also penalize the player.

Tchoutchou is inspired by games such as Faster Than Light, The Oregon Trail, This War Of Mine and Papers, Please.
